## Welcome!
I've been using **GNU/Linux** for a time, and I **love it!** Coding is my passion.

Here is my top projects :

- [Solar Golf](https://github.com/StrayRaider/solargolf) A game Developed with SDL-based Python library Pygame during my high school years. I continue to work on it using C++ SDL, and it will soon be available on the Play Store. [Solar SDL](https://github.com/StrayRaider/SolarSdl)

- [Titrek](https://github.com/StrayRaider/titrek) Titrek is an open-source ground control application developed using pyGtk, pyMavlink. It was designed specifically to establish communication with Pixhawk 2.4.8 and graph data. (IEEE KOU Technic Team Project)

- [Academic Search](https://github.com/StrayRaider/Academic_Search) It utilizes web scraping techniques to collect information from Google Scholar and stores it in a MongoDB database. the project features a Django web application that allows users to search through the academic data.

- [Maze Solver Robot](https://github.com/StrayRaider/maze_solver_robot) An application that generates mazes of specified sizes using an algorithm developed by me, accompanied by a robot programmed to solve them as efficiently as possible using another algorithm I've developed. The interface for this system is crafted using Python GTK.

In addition to these projects, I also focus on DevOps practices, container systems, and Linux.

Currently, I'm learning mostly: Docker, Python, C, and Linux.
